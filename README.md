Welcome to my Memory Game!

To start the game open the 'index.html' file with your browser. What appears in front of you is a Memory Game. 
The goal of the game is to get all the pairs right. Per turn you can flip two cards, each showing one of the 8 images. 
When you find two of the same images in one turn, the pair stays visible. When your guess was wrong the cards flip back again. 
You will have to use your memory to remember where the cards were. 

Have fun playing the game!
